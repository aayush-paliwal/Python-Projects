// webapp 
- To create this run: django-admin startapp webapp
- This is the folder where I have all the logic for the app like urls, models.
- In order to use this webapp we need to configure it in settings.py file in crm folder


- To run django server run: python manage.py runserver
- To run migration: python manage.py migrate
- To create superuser: python manage.py createsuperuser
  Now with that we can go to the /admin route in the browser


- By default urls are served from the urls.py file in the crm folder. But we want them to be served from webapp urls.py
  file. So for that we need make some change in crm urls.py file
- To use CSS, JS we need to setup static files. Create static folder in crm and specify its location in settings.py file.
